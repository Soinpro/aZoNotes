Convenient tool for saving down notes without the need of .txt management and other fun stuff

Made for a school assignment but i decided to expand on it : D

## Current Functionality
* you can create, delete and save down notes (duh)
* you can to apply tags to notes for further organization
* you can also rename a note by double clicking on it, incase you named your note in a hurry
* you can customize your smart notes experience with settings such as changing styles (and more to come)

More features will be added if i feel like it
