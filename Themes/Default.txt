This is an empty style sheet.
Make sure to remove all unrelated text and format it properly!
(Also make sure the file extension is .txt)
Use https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6/overviews/stylesheet-examples.html for stylesheet help!
For reference, Smart Notes uses QTextEdit, QLineEdit, QLabel, QPushButton, QListWidget widgets.
Have fun making themes :D
